There are several useful window methods in JavaScript that can come in 
handy when developing web applications. Here are a few:  

- window.alert(): Displays an alert dialog with the specified text.  
- window.confirm(): Displays a dialog with a message that the user needs to 
  respond to.  
- window.prompt(): Displays a dialog with an optional message prompting the 
  user to input some text.  
- window.open(): Opens a new browser window.  
- window.close(): Closes the current window.  
- window.setTimeout(): Sets a timer which executes a function or specified 
  piece of code once the timer expires.  
- window.setInterval(): Repeatedly calls a function or executes a code 
  snippet, with a fixed time delay between each call.  
- window.clearTimeout(): Clears a delay set by window.setTimeout().  
- window.clearInterval(): Clears a delay set by window.setInterval().  
- window.fetch(): Provides a global fetch() method that provides an easy, 
  logical way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network.  
- window.localStorage: Allows to save key/value pairs in a web browser. The 
  data stored in localStorage persists until explicitly deleted.  
- window.sessionStorage: Similar to localStorage but expires when the browser 
  tab is closed.  
- window.addEventListener(): Sets up a function that will be called whenever 
  the specified event is delivered to the target.  
- window.removeEventListener(): Removes an event handler that has been 
  attached with the addEventListener() method.  
- window.location: Contains information about the current URL and methods to 
  manipulate it.  
- window.history: Allows manipulation of the browser session history, that is 
  the pages visited in the tab or frame that the current page is loaded in.
